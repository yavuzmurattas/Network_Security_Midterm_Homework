Malware refers to computer viruses as well as many other types of harmful software, such as computer worms, trojan horses, keyloggers, and so on. Malwares can infiltrate the system via e-mails by using phishing methods, and also via files which are downloaded, usb flash memories, etc. You can be protected from malware thanks to antivirus software. Anti-virus software detects, finds, and removes malware from your computer while also ensuring that it functions properly. Anti-virus software typically employs a variety of strategies in virus removal solutions, such as scanning files and matching files to existing virus dictionaries/databases to find matches and determine anomalous computer activity, such as slow computer performance. 3.1 Anti-Virus Methods # Antivirus programs identify viruses using a variety of detection methods. Some of the methods are described in the following sub-sections. 3.1.1 Signature Detection Programs # These programs search RAM and files for signatures specific to a particular virus and, if found, publish a corresponding message. The problem of such anti-virus programs is that they only detect viruses which the developers of such programs know. 3.1.2 Data Analyzing # Data analyzing includes auditors. The consequences are manifested in data changes that should not be changed. For the auditor, the fact that data has changed indicates the presence of malware. Auditors check the integrity of the data and assess whether malware is present in the computer environment in the event of a breach of integrity. 3.1.3 Cyclic Redundancy Check # The Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) process is based on calculating the checksums of the files on the disc. These Cyclic Redundancy Check values are then kept in the antivirus database, along with some other information, such as the file's length and the date it was last changed. These scanners compare the data in the database to the calculated values. Assume the information in the database file discards the actual values. CRC scanners indicate that the file has been modified or is infected with a virus in this situation. Because their database does not contain information about viruses in new files, CRC scanners cannot detect them immediately. Furthermore, regular viruses exploit the vulnerability in CRC scanners, infecting only recently created files and so remaining invisible to them. 3.1.4 Analytical Scrutinize # These programs are among the most reliable tools for virus protection since they remember the initial state of programs, directories, and disc system areas when the computer was not affected with a virus. Then, occasionally or at the user's request, they compare the current condition to the original. These programs have advanced algorithms, detect stealth viruses, and even clean up changes to the program\u2019s scanned version from the changes introduced by the virus. 3.2 Anti-Virus Evasion Techniques # Cybercriminals have developed various strategies to evade anti-virus systems in order to achieve their goals. These include: 3.2.1 Code Packing and Encryption # Hackers design special utilities for packaging and encrypting data, such as CryptExe, Exeref, and PolyCrypt. Since the vast majority of worms and trojans are encrypted and packaged, to detect packed and encrypted worms and trojans, the antivirus program must either add new unpacking and decoding methods or add new signatures for each malicious program sample. 3.2.2 Code Mutation # Cybercriminals try to camouflage their dangerous software by mixing a trojan virus's code and spam instructions, so that the code takes on a different appearance while preserving the trojan's original functionality. Code mutation can occur in real time at times. This approach was exploited by the Warezov mail worm, which created major problems for users.","title":"Anti-Virus Software"},{"location":"anti_virus/#30_anti-virus_software","text":"Malware is any software that is intentionally designed to disrupt a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or interfere with the user's computer security and privacy.

Encryption/decryption is a widely used method for keeping information private. Encryption and decryption are the fundamental functions of cryptography. A simple message (plain text) gets turned into an unreadable form called cypher text during encryption. A cypher text is turned into the original text (plaintext) during decryption. Both of these functions are used to secure message against who is not authorized to view the message contents. 4.1 What is Encryption? # Through the use of a special key known as an encryption key, data can be mathematically or cryptographically converted into a cypher text using the encryption technique. Depending on whether symmetric or asymmetric encryption is being used, either the same key or a separate key can be used to decrypt the data. This section provides a detailed description of open-source tools that can be used to encrypt sensitive data, protecting it from being compromised by simply exposure to attackers. We have divided encryption-based tools into the following four groups in this work: Full Disk Encryption Encrypted Internet Traffic File Encryption Software Email encryption 4.1.1 Full Disk Encryption # A type of cryptographic encryption called full disc encryption (FDE) is used at the hardware level to encrypt data, files, operating systems, and other programs. The drawback of this is that it can cause delays when memory is severely depleted, particularly with virtual machines where access time may get delayed. The following is a description of the tools included in this category: LUKS : FDE tool, called Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS), is mainly utilized in environments based on Linux. It uses the dm-crypt as a backend encryption disc because it is based on the cryptsetup program. Greater flexibility in the use of different encryption methods is made possible by LUKS. It also guarantees that password management is used by all parties in a documented, safe manner and facilitates interoperability across different systems. BitLocker : BitLocker is a full-featured Windows-based Microsoft encryption tool. By default, it employs the AES encryption algorithm in Cypher Block Chaining or the XTS mode with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. 4.1.2 Encrypted Internet Traffic # It is easy for a user to encrypt their internet traffic. End users can prevent pointless information gathering by using internet encryption solutions. They offer a relatively secure environment for using the internet. VPN services such as NordVPN might serve as example for this type of encryption. Secure Shell (SSH) can also be given as an example to this category. A cryptographic network protocol called Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is used to operate network services safely over insecure networks. Command-line execution and remote login are two of its most prominent uses. 4.1.3 File Encryption Software # By encrypting the contents of files created and exchanged between users, file encryption tool adds an extra degree of security The following is a description of the tools this category: Encrypto : Encrypto is a simple-to-use program that shares files using the closest available sharing methods after encrypting them using AES-256 encryption. Although it is primarily made for Apple products, the software is compatible with Windows and Mac OS. Cryptmount : This open-source file encryption program may encrypt a specific filing system and is compatible with Linux. 4.1.4 Email Encryption # Emails are encrypted while being transmitted over the internet, but the main content is still in plain text, leaving it vulnerable to theft by outsiders. Both end-to-end and transport level encryption are necessary to foil attempts to access information by outside agents. Because popular email services like Outlook and Gmail do not by default offer end-to-end encryption, encrypting emails requires the use of specialized software. Here is a discussion of a few email encryption tools. Mailvelope : End-to-end encryption of email traffic is achieved through the use of this open-source software. Mailvelope is compatible with popular web email applications including Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, and others. Web email applications with OpenPGP capability are implemented by Mailvelope. ProtonMail : An encrypted email service that is accessible since 2013. Before moving to the ProtonMail servers, it employs end-user side encryption to regulate user data and email content. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that offers cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication, in addition to the categories mentioned above. PGP is used to improve the security of e-mail communications as well as to sign, encrypt, and decrypt files, directories, texts, e-mails, even entire disc partitions. PGP and related programs encrypt and decrypt data in accordance with the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) , which is an open standard of PGP encryption software. Crypto API in Kernel can also be used. A wide range of cryptographic cyphers, additional data transformation techniques, and methods to invoke these are all provided via Crypto API in Kernel.","title":"What is Cryptography?"},{"location":"cryptography/#40_what_is_cryptography","text":"Cryptography is the art of secret writing that has been used since Roman times to conceal information or keep messages confidential.

Because firewall can be also beaten in cyber war or attack. Furthermore, if it is configured wrong, then it will gradually decrease the network traffic of the system because it may obstruct all or highly portion of the incoming traffic so that useful information or even alerts coming from other systems etc. cannot be reached. Hence, firewall cannot be used by itself. Some other protection tools must or even have to be used in the system to increase the security as well. Two of those protection tools called Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) are described and given pros and cons thereof below. 2.1 Intrusion Detection System # An intrusion detection system's (IDS) job is to find dangers in network traffic and then notify a network administrator with a report or a warning. Thus, the threat within the system won't be removed by it. The IDS then reviews a copy of the traffic. Since the IDS device processes its own copy, it adds no latency to network traffic. Installing intrusion detection systems is crucial in any area where network traffic from outside sources is permitted to enter private or controlled networks. For instance, as Figure 4 depicts a lot of businesses with Internet access decide to put in place network-based intrusion detection systems both behind firewalls and in their DMZ networks. Figure 4. IDS operation (IDS IPS, n.d.) 2.1.1 Intrusion Detection Methodology # The variety in network configuration allows for the availability of multiple types of intrusion detection methodologies. They all have unique benefits and drawbacks in terms of detection, configuration, and price. 2.1.1.1 Signature Based Detection # A pattern associated with a recognized threat is called a signature. In signature-based detection, potential undesired traffic is found by comparing observed events to pre-defined signatures. This kind of detecting method is incredibly quick and easy to configure. When it comes to identifying unknown threats, signature-based detection is mainly ineffective. However, it is highly effective in identifying known threats. 2.1.1.2 Anomaly Based Detection # The practice of comparing definitions of what constitutes normal behavior to actual occurrences in order to spot notable anomalies is known as anomaly-based detection. The main advantage of anomaly-based detection techniques is their potential utility in identifying undesired traffic that is not explicitly known. It simply signals that something is abnormal rather than identifying a specific sort of malformation. 2.1.1.3 Stateful Protocol Analysis # The practice of comparing preset profiles of widely recognized criteria of benign protocol activity at each protocol state against observed events in order to spot deviations is known as stateful protocol analysis . 2.1.2 Types of Intrusion Detection System # Based on the kinds of events they monitor and how they are implemented, intrusion detection systems have variety of forms. In this document, we address the four types that follow: Network Based IDS Wireless IDS Network Behavior Anomaly Detection Host Based IDS 2.1.2.1 Network Based Ids # These devices keep an eye on network activity in search of signs of an attack. Simply put, attack signatures are character strings that are frequently seen throughout an attack. Because a single system can monitor several systems and resources, network-based intrusion detection is typically more successful than host-based intrusion detection. Problems with network-based intrusion detection include: Attack signatures that are dispersed over several packets are often missed by network-based intrusion systems. It is not appropriate for protecting every host on the network. A lot of intrusion detection systems are devoid of the features required to recognize attacks at the network layer. In other words, not every assault will have a recognizable attack signature. 2.1.2.2 Wireless Ids # In that it is capable of analyzing network traffic, a WLAN intrusion detection system (IDS) is comparable to an NIDS. It will, however, also examine wireless-specific traffic, such as looking for users outside of the company's physical boundaries and external users attempting to connect to access points (AP). 2.1.2.3 Network Behavior Anomaly Detection # Network behaviour anomaly detection (NBAD) examines network segment traffic to look for any anomalies in the amount or type of the traffic. 2.1.2.4 Host Based Ids # Software agents are installed on each computer host connected to the network in host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) technology in order to monitor events that happen exclusively on that host. Network traffic and system-specific configurations, including software calls, local security policies, audits of local logs, and more, are analyzed by HIDS. The majority of the time, HIDS are installed on critical hosts, like servers that are open to the public and those that hold private data. However, they result in a significant overhead for the hosts who employ them. 2.2 Intrusion Prevention System # Intrusion Prevention System , or IPS , monitor spacket traffic in real time for malicious activity or patterns that match. When these patterns are detected, it can generate warnings and drop or block the traffic in real time as it passes across the network. The key functionalities performed by an IPS are as follows: IPS detects and takes preventive actions against malicious attacks IPS stops the attack itself IPS changes the security environment IPS changes the attack\u2019s contents Figure 5. IPS operation (IDS IPS, n.d.) 2.3 Difference between IPS and Firewall Systems # When compared to a firewall, an IPS is superior. Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are control mechanisms. They sit between two networks and manage the traffic that passes across them. The primary distinction between a firewall and an intrusion prevention system is how they manage network traffic. Whereas a firewall blocks all requests that do not meet its safety definition, an intrusion prevention system (IPS) permits all requests save those whose contents appear to be malicious and potentially dangerous to the system. 2.4 Snort # This application comes from the well-known tcpdump , a sniffer that is included in every UNIX system. Snort is an open-source application, which implies that the entire solution is free to use and that you can modify any component of the source code. You can also make your own rules. Finally, you may set Snort to work with your firewall to create a complete IPS system. Definitions can be used to notify the administrator, monitoring server, or firewall at the output module. The output format can also be defined. Although SNORT is a main program and one of the oldest programs in IDS/IPS systems, there are also newly-developed programs like Suricata in this field. 2.5 Attack Types to IDS/IPS Systems # IDSs are common defense systems at the packet-based network layer. Attackers intend to circumvent this systems using three sorts of generic attacks. 2.5.1 Evasion Attack # Packets are sent to both the IDS and the target in these assaults. Although the IDS rejects these packets (not because they are attacks), the target host accepts them. Because the IDS does not check the content of the packets it rejects or drops, it cannot determine whether they are an attack or not. Thus, the attacker sends some or all of the malicious traffic to the network, without being controlled by the IDS. 2.5.2 Insertion Attack # In these attacks; Among the packages sent to both the end user and the IDS, there may be some that are accepted by the IDS that the end user does not accept. The package is only valid on IDS. The attacker who can use this situation appropriately; By adding an appropriate packet traffic, it can prevent analysis in attack detection with signature analysis. Because with a packet that is not accepted by the end user, the IDS is convinced that that packet group is not an attack. 2.5.3 Denial-of-service (DoS) Attack # These are attacks aimed at consuming or completely disabling IDS or system resources. In this way, IDS becomes unable to analyze all incoming traffic. The most common type or feature of a DoS attack is that it overwhelms the victim with its requests. If these requests are sent from more than one source at a time, it is called a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack.","title":"Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)"},{"location":"ids_ips/#20_intrusion_detection_system_ids_and_intrusion_prevention_system_ips","text":"Firewalls are not enough to protect a system from potential threats and attacks.

Otherwise, due to those complexity and width of the network, hackers or some can try to attack to the system and maybe even infiltrate to the system easily. In this way, they can steal the critical information, sell them, or the worse is that they can spread their attacks to the systems which are connect to the infiltrated system. The best way of ensuring interface security is the use of a firewall. Devices or systems known as network firewalls regulate the movement of data between networks using various security stances. An organisation can stop unwanted access to the relevant systems and resources within the more sensitive regions by using firewalls to regulate connectivity to departments. The firewall is also the first line of defence for your network security measures. Your data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability are protected by a firewall. While outside the purview of this work, the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model can be used to compare the characteristics of firewalls. Numerous firewalls can function on this model's multiple layers, including the Application Layer, which permits the usage of user authentication. 1.1 Types of Firewalls # Here, three popular firewalls with their pros and cons will be briefly covered. 1. The easiest firewall to set up is packet filtering . IP addresses, subnets, TCP or UDP port numbers, and other preset specification criteria can be used by firewalls to filter packets based on packet content comparison. The packet filter is the easiest firewall technology to set up, adding one to a router has little to no additional performance overhead, and since it functions at both the network and transport layers, it is compatible with all applications. These are the benefits of using this kind of firewall. Packet filter firewalls have a number of drawbacks, including the inability to stop attacks that use application-specific vulnerabilities since packet filter firewalls do not inspect upper-layer data. An application's commands, for instance, cannot be blocked by a packet filter firewall; if an application is allowed, the firewall will permit all of its functionalities. Therefore, high-speed situations where logging and user authentication with network resources are not critical are a great fit for packet filter firewalls. 2. Stateful-inspection is an enhancement of the packet filter technology. This type of firewalls can also inspect the state of the packet like whether or not it is in the new connection stare or established state, or any other state. Accordingly, they can take decision. This kind of firewall has the advantages of low overhead and high throughput. Compared to the packet filtering model, the stateful-inspection offers more security without significantly degrading performance. This kind of firewall has the following drawbacks: provides no user authentication and necessitates more administrative setup than packet filtering. 3. The proxy acts as a bridge between your internal servers and the servers on the Internet. The proxy serves as a server to clients on your internal network for incoming data. The Proxy serves as a client for outgoing data, sending information to servers on the open external network. Benefits of this kind of firewall include the ability to execute user-level authentication and the application proxy operates at the application layer, thus providing the highest level of security and granularity. The most difficult firewall to build, the possibility of a performance bottleneck, and that proxy services may require different servers for each service are the drawbacks of this kind of firewall. 1.2 Limitations of Firewalls # Firewalls offer unquestionable benefits in terms of network security, but they are not without restrictions. The following are some restrictions to be mindful of. The high cost of firewalls is one of its disadvantages. Although firewalls are installed to provide network security, they are still vulnerable to attacks. They can be defeated by direct attacks; or the easier way to \u201cbreak through\u201d a firewall is by never touching it but simply bypassing it. A firewall is no real defense against malicious code problems like viruses and Trojan horses, although some are capable of scanning the code for telltale signs. 1.3 Firewall Environments # The term firewall environment refers to the collection of devices and systems that work together to provide or support the complete firewall functionality at a specific network location. All that is needed in a simple firewall environment can be a packet filter firewall. It could include several firewalls, proxies, and particular topologies like star, linear bus and tree to support the systems and security in a more sophisticated and secure setting. The systems utilized in common firewall setups are described in detail in the following sections. 1.3.1 DMZ Networks # The most popular way to build a firewall environment is through a DeMilitarized Zone network, or DMZ . A DMZ network is created out of a network connecting two firewalls. DMZ networks serve as attachment points for computer systems and resources that need to be accessible either externally or internally, but that should not be placed on internal protected networks. The firewalls could provide protection and access control for the servers, protecting them both from external and internal attack. This environment is represented in Fig. 1. Figure 1. Demilitarized Zone formed by two Firewalls. There are various benefits to using a DMZ. By adding an additional layer of security between a company's internal network and the Internet, it first aids in enhancing security. As a result, it is harder for outside threats to access an organization's internal network. Secondly, by relocating specific services, such web hosting, to a separate DMZ network, a DMZ can also benefit from the network performance. This can lessen the strain on an organization's internal network and enhance network functionality as a whole. There are many examples of hacked DMZs. Below examples highlight the significance of having strong security and checking the DMZ frequently to find and address vulnerabilities. The DMZ of Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014. The hackers, who have ties to North Korea, stole sensitive information and made it public. Sony suffered significant losses as a result of the breach, and many people lost their jobs. The US Department of Justice's DMZ experienced a hack in 2016. The hackers, who were linked to Russia, obtained personal data on employees and their families. 1.3.2 Virtual Private Networks # Another beneficial application of firewalls and firewall environments is the creation of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). In most circumstances, virtual private networks are used to create secure network links across untrusted networks by employing additional protocols and, in most cases, encryption. Figure 2. Differences of a network with and without a VPN As depicted in Fig 2, an organization or agency can send unencrypted network traffic from systems behind the firewall to other remote systems behind a cooperating VPN gateway; the firewall encrypts the traffic and forwards it to the remote VPN gateway, which decrypts it and forwards it to the destination systems. Advanced virtual private network capabilities have a cost. For example, if VPN communication is encrypted, performance will decrease in proportion to (a) the volume of traffic flowing across the virtual private network and (b) the type/length of encryption utilized. There are various options available to a modern virtual private network at the protocol level. The first is a group of protocols called IPSec11 (Internet Protocol Security), which is arguably the most widely utilized at the moment. The IPSec standards consist of IPv6 security features ported over to IPv4, the version of IP in use today on the Internet. Other VPN protocols in use today include the Microsoft standard PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol). 1.3.3 Intranets and Extranets # An intranet is a network that uses the same kinds of protocols, services, and applications as an Internet implementation, but without requiring external connectivity or outside access. Many of the security issues inherent in Internet implementations also exist in intranet implementations since intranets use the same protocols and application services as the Internet. Therefore, intranets are typically implemented behind firewall environments. In Fig. 3, the internal protected networks are examples of intranet configurations. Figure 3. VPN/Extranet Joining Two Intranets With the exception of the fact that they are intended to operate outside of a firewall environment, extranets and intranets almost entirely correspond in terms of features. By definition, the purpose of an extranet is to provide access to potentially sensitive information to specific remote users or organizations, but at the same time denying access to general external users and systems. 1.4 Firewall Policy # The way a firewall handles application traffic like web, email, or telnet is determined by its policy. The policy must specify the updating and management procedures for the firewall. Firewalls without a policy can be difficult to maintain and complicated, and security issues can happen on a regular basis. The following are the steps needed to create a firewall policy: Identification of network applications that are deemed necessary, Identification of vulnerabilities related to those applications, Cost-benefits analysis of methods for securing the applications, Creation of a firewall ruleset based on the applications traffic matrix. 1.5 pfSense # pfSense is a free and open source operating system for routers and firewalls. The majority of commodity hardware, including outdated PCs and embedded systems, can run pfSense. pfSense is commonly configured and managed via a user-friendly web interface, which simplifies administration for individuals with no networking expertise as well. pfSense is primarily used as a router and firewall software. It is configured as DHCP server, DNS server, Wi-Fi access point, VPN server, all running on the same hardware device. It can be used to run a huge corporation's whole network or even just a modest home router. 1.6 Firewall Testing # The four processes that make up firewall testing are indirect information collection, direct information collection, attack from the outside, attack from the inside There are detail expressions about each of these processes in the sections that follow. 1.6.1 Indirect Information Collection # At first, we aim to learn as much as we can about our target. In order to accomplish this, we first gather data in a manner that is invisible to logging or alarm systems. For this purpose, publicly available information from sources outside the network can be used. These are services to gain an idea of the targeted network's structure, such as whois or nslookup . Doing an online search is another way to find information. 1.6.2 Direct Information Collection # Additional information that the company\u2019s name server could have been stored on the network topology may be investigated at first. For instance, bounced mail headers can provide important information. We can send an email to a nonexistent user to obtain more details about important systems in our target network. The header of the bounced message may provide important topographic data. 1.6.3 Attack from The Outside # This section now discusses direct attacks from the outside. Our targets include the firewall itself, as well as other specifically targeted systems such hosts that appear to be connected to the outside world but are not firewall-protected. If the firewall trusts any hosts, which is generally not the case, then this can offer us extra benefits. Possessing control over one of these systems also helps us later on when we want to attempt an IP spoofing attack. Another general concept is that we are launching our attacks from different subnets as the firewall could trust on of these addresses. For instance, an IP spoofing attack can be used in this kind of attack. IP Spoofing # In network intrusions IP address spoofing can be utilized, which is the use of a legitimate IP address to get around IP address-based authentication. When there are trust ties between machines, this kind of assault is most effective. Using your internet or networked system, you will establish a connection to another system, but you want to conceal the fact that you are the one connecting. You misrepresent your IP address, which is your identity in TCP/IP protocols, during the connection for this purpose. We refer to this as IP spoofing. Using tools like Nemesis and other similar programs, the attacker spoofs his own IP packets and modifies their source IP field. Reactions corresponding to the spoofed packet cannot reach the attacker's computer since the source has been altered. It is sent to the spoofed machine. \"Source routing\" is a crucial method the attacker employed to get this response on his own computer. Nemesis is a command-line network packet crafting and injection utility for UNIX-like and Windows systems. Excellent for testing firewalls, IP stacks, network intrusion detection systems, and many other activities. ARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets may all be natively crafted and injected by Nemesis. It is possible to create and inject nearly any custom packet using the IP and Ethernet injection modes. 1.6.4 Attack from The Inside of the Network # The firewall in this case is the target, or more likely, the operating system that the firewall is installed on. This is now more related to host security than network security because the firewall\u2014the target of the attack\u2014is the host.","title":"What is Firewall?"},{"location":"what_is_firewall/#10_what_is_firewall","text":"Sophisticated security technologies must be developed at the interface between networks of different domains due to the rising complexity and width of a network.

Below examples highlight the significance of having strong security and checking the DMZ frequently to find and address vulnerabilities. The DMZ of Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014. The hackers, who have ties to North Korea, stole sensitive information and made it public. Sony suffered significant losses as a result of the breach, and many people lost their jobs. The US Department of Justice's DMZ experienced a hack in 2016. The hackers, who were linked to Russia, obtained personal data on employees and their families.","title":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3.1 DMZ Networks"},{"location":"what_is_firewall/#132_virtual_private_networks","text":"Another beneficial application of firewalls and firewall environments is the creation of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). In most circumstances, virtual private networks are used to create secure network links across untrusted networks by employing additional protocols and, in most cases, encryption. Figure 2. Differences of a network with and without a VPN As depicted in Fig 2, an organization or agency can send unencrypted network traffic from systems behind the firewall to other remote systems behind a cooperating VPN gateway; the firewall encrypts the traffic and forwards it to the remote VPN gateway, which decrypts it and forwards it to the destination systems. Advanced virtual private network capabilities have a cost. For example, if VPN communication is encrypted, performance will decrease in proportion to (a) the volume of traffic flowing across the virtual private network and (b) the type/length of encryption utilized. There are various options available to a modern virtual private network at the protocol level. The first is a group of protocols called IPSec11 (Internet Protocol Security), which is arguably the most widely utilized at the moment. The IPSec standards consist of IPv6 security features ported over to IPv4, the version of IP in use today on the Internet. Other VPN protocols in use today include the Microsoft standard PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol).","title":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3.2 Virtual Private Networks"},{"location":"what_is_firewall/#133_intranets_and_extranets","text":"An intranet is a network that uses the same kinds of protocols, services, and applications as an Internet implementation, but without requiring external connectivity or outside access. Many of the security issues inherent in Internet implementations also exist in intranet implementations since intranets use the same protocols and application services as the Internet. Therefore, intranets are typically implemented behind firewall environments. In Fig. 3, the internal protected networks are examples of intranet configurations. Figure 3. VPN/Extranet Joining Two Intranets With the exception of the fact that they are intended to operate outside of a firewall environment, extranets and intranets almost entirely correspond in terms of features. By definition, the purpose of an extranet is to provide access to potentially sensitive information to specific remote users or organizations, but at the same time denying access to general external users and systems.","title":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3.3 Intranets and Extranets"},{"location":"what_is_firewall/#14_firewall_policy","text":"The way a firewall handles application traffic like web, email, or telnet is determined by its policy.

Our targets include the firewall itself, as well as other specifically targeted systems such hosts that appear to be connected to the outside world but are not firewall-protected. If the firewall trusts any hosts, which is generally not the case, then this can offer us extra benefits. Possessing control over one of these systems also helps us later on when we want to attempt an IP spoofing attack. Another general concept is that we are launching our attacks from different subnets as the firewall could trust on of these addresses. For instance, an IP spoofing attack can be used in this kind of attack.","title":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6.3 Attack from The Outside"},{"location":"what_is_firewall/#ip_spoofing","text":"In network intrusions IP address spoofing can be utilized, which is the use of a legitimate IP address to get around IP address-based authentication. When there are trust ties between machines, this kind of assault is most effective. Using your internet or networked system, you will establish a connection to another system, but you want to conceal the fact that you are the one connecting. You misrepresent your IP address, which is your identity in TCP/IP protocols, during the connection for this purpose. We refer to this as IP spoofing. Using tools like Nemesis and other similar programs, the attacker spoofs his own IP packets and modifies their source IP field. Reactions corresponding to the spoofed packet cannot reach the attacker's computer since the source has been altered. It is sent to the spoofed machine. \"Source routing\" is a crucial method the attacker employed to get this response on his own computer. Nemesis is a command-line network packet crafting and injection utility for UNIX-like and Windows systems. Excellent for testing firewalls, IP stacks, network intrusion detection systems, and many other activities. ARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets may all be natively crafted and injected by Nemesis.
